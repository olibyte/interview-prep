# Interview Prep Library

This project is a library designed to help you prepare for your technical interviews. It provides a collection of common interview questions, coding challenges, and helpful resources.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interview-prep.git
   cd interview-prep
   ```

2. Install dependencies with npm or package manager of your choice (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. This auto-update is called hot reloading.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `npm start`: Runs the app in production mode.

- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.

## Project Structure


This structure reflects the Next.js 13+ App Router convention:
- `app/`: Contains the main application code
  - `components/`: Reusable React components
  - `layout.tsx`: The root layout component
  - `page.tsx`: The main page component
  - `globals.css`: Global styles
- `public/`: Static assets like images

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
